# functions are like mini programs inside the overall program
# functions main purpose is to get rid of duplicate code
# def statement defines a function name and input
# input to functions are arguments - output is return value
# parameters are variables in between the functions parenthesis
# return value is specified with return statement
# every function has return value. if undefined default is return None (like null js)

# from https: // www.pythoncentral.io/python-null-equivalent-none/
# None is an object - a class. Not a basic type, such as digits, or True and False.
# In Python 3.x, the type object was changed to new style classes. However the behaviour of None is the same.
# Because None is an object, we cannot use it to check if a variable exists. It is a value/object, not an operator used to check a condition.
