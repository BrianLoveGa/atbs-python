Answer __A__

for this course it's taught using python 3

Also - python 2 is no longer supported as of a few months from now. I've heard April 2020

Learning python 2 qwould be like learning how to maintain a steam engine.

They were great but I'm not gonna use one when there are better options avaliable now.
